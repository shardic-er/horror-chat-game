# Digital Consciousness Recovery Interface

A psychological horror browser game where players navigate through fragmented digital consciousness, attempting to rebuild their vocabulary and understanding while interacting with various AI entities.

## Concept
Players take on the role of a digitalized consciousness struggling to reconstruct itself after a traumatic virtualization process. Through limited vocabulary interactions with AI entities, players must piece together their identity and circumstances while uncovering the dark truth behind their situation.

## Core Mechanics
- Limited vocabulary system starting with only 10 basic words
- Word-limited chat interface
- Word discovery through context and guessing
- Multiple AI personalities with unique conversation patterns
- Progressive narrative revelation through successful interactions

- Styled Components & React Bootstrap for UI
- Node.js with Express.js backend
- Socket.io for multiplayer features
- OpenAI GPT-4 API for AI interactions
